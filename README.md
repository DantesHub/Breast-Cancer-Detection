# Breast-Cancer-Detection
Dataset is from: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+%28diagnostic%29 <br>
Environment: Google Colab <br>
Languages and libraries used: Python, matplotlib,scikit-learn, seaborn, numpy <br>
Cleaned and analyzed dataset. Then trained and used 4 different machine learning models from scikit learn:<br>
Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Decision Tree  and Logistic Regression  <br>
whether a patient would have breast cancer based on the features of the dataset. All models had very good accuarcy <br>
due to the fact that the dataset was so large and was already mostly ready to be used for training. <br>
However it seemed that Support Vector Machines had by far the best accuarcy rate: 98%.
